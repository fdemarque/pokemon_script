# pokemon_script
this is a script for bash 'bout pok√©mons!

This script runs on bash. It uses the data of some documents (.txt) to organize the information about two pokemons that the user will choose (by typing the poke name).

then it saves this information in two new documents (also .txt) and shows it at the end.

As soon as possible I'll improve it by setting the script to describe a battle between the two pokemons.
